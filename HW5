# I have either had the errors: no applicable pull applied to an object of class function or -x- must be a vector of 1 or more
# something in the count line is throwing everything off. 
# making changes or mutating the data format does nothing to help the cause -numeric, character, or factor all results the same
# the data is not able to be made into a corpus without error and tokenizng the data is unavailable.
# absolutely 0 problems were encountered with the football tweet data and when I try to pull it up it displays the same framework as the gop debates
